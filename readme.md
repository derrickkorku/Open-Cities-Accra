Built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/), 

This web application was developed as part of the Open Cities Accra project. The project sought to collect and curate up-to-date and accurate geospatial data in the following areas of interest in Accra: Akweteyman, Alajo, Alogboshie and Nima. This web application was developed as a data tool to help government agencies, institutions and other stakeholders working in the Disaster Risk Management field take data-driven decisions in their work. The maps display the following data - buildings, flood history and drainage.
